===Building Tiramisu===

+ Dependencies & Instructions

    * install clang-8, pthreads, libdl, zlib1g-dev (ubuntu), pybind11, python3.6+
    * git clone -b physl_2019 --single-branch https://github.com/ct-clmsn/tiramisu.git
    * modify as necessary `$(TIRAMISU_ROOT)/configure.cmake`
    * run `mkdir $(TIRAMISU_ROOT)/build`
    * change directory into `cd $(TIRAMISU_ROOT)/build`
    * run `cmake ..` in `$(TIRAMISU_ROOT)/build`
    * build tiramisu with `make -j tiramisu`
    * check `$(TIRAMISU_ROOT)/build` for 'libtiramisu.so'
    * symlink `ln -s $(TIRAMISU_ROOT)/build/libtiramisu.so .` into the `phyflow/backend' directory
    * change directory to the `phyflow/backend` directory
    * open the makefile in `phyflow/backend`
    * modify these variables in the makefile ISL_SOURCE_BASE_DIR, ISL_INSTALLED_ROOT_DIR, TIRAMISU_ROOT_DIR
    * execute `make` in the phyflow/backend directory

+ Notes

The physl_2019 branch in the tiramisu repository is significantly modified. Halide will not be a dependency used, C code export support is enabled (code edit), along with g++ being the default compiler used (check all '*.sh' files in the tiramisu/utils/code_generator/ directory for details or if you need to use clang++ instead).

Building this backend requires referencing the source tree for isl. Extending isl to support physl requires referencing isl_ast_private.h which is not part of the isl install manifest. isl_ast_private.h can only be found in the source tree isl.

This backend modifies tiramisu and isl to support exporting physl and it provides python bindings for tiramisu and modifications to tiramisu that support physl. This source tree may serve as a resource for learning how to extend isl support for other languages and how to modify tiramisu for the same purpose.
